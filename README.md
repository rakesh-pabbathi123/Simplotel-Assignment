## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the webpage.
- `index.css`: Contains the styles and responsive rules for the webpage.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file is structured into several sections:

1. **Header Section**:
   - Contains a logo, navigation links, and social media icons.
   - The header is designed using a `flexbox` layout for easy alignment of items.

2. **Banner Section**:
   - Displays a large banner image with a text overlay.
   - The text is positioned absolutely over the image using CSS.

3. **Lorem Ipsum Section**:
   - A section with three cards containing dummy text.
   - The cards are arranged using a `flexbox` layout for equal spacing.

4. **Features Section**:
   - Highlights different features (Rooms, Dining, Pools) with images and descriptions.
   - Each feature is presented as a card with a hover effect to enhance user interaction.

## CSS Styling

The CSS file (`index.css`) defines the following styles:

1. **Global Styles**:
   - Applied a reset for margins, padding, and box-sizing to ensure consistency.
   - Set a default font and background color for the body.

2. **Header Styles**:
   - The header is styled to be fixed at the top with a dark background.
   - Navigation links and social icons are styled for easy readability and interaction.

3. **Banner Styles**:
   - The banner image is set to be full-width and responsive.
   - The banner text is positioned at the bottom-left corner with a semi-transparent background for contrast.

4. **Lorem Ipsum Section Styles**:
   - The section is styled with a background color and the cards are spaced evenly using `flexbox`.
   - The cards are designed to be flexible and adjust their width based on the screen size.

5. **Features Section Styles**:
   - The features are displayed as cards with shadow effects and hover transformations.
   - Images are set to fill the card width, with rounded corners for a polished look.
   - Buttons are styled with a dark background and smooth transition effects on hover.

## Responsive Design

The webpage is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes:

1. **768px and Below**:
   - The features section switches from a horizontal layout to a vertical one for better readability on smaller screens.
   - Navigation links stack vertically for easy access on mobile devices.

2. **576px and Below**:
   - The banner text is resized for better readability on very small screens.
   - Padding and margins are adjusted to maintain a clean layout without crowding the content.

## Credits

- **Images**: The images used in the webpage are sourced from Cloudinary and other public resources.
- **Icons**: Social media icons are sourced from free online resources.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the webpage.
3. Modify the `index.css` file to customize the styles or add new sections as needed.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the creation of a simple yet effective responsive webpage using HTML and CSS. The use of `flexbox` for layout management and media queries for responsiveness ensures that the page looks great on all devices.
